Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

0. _putchar
Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print alphabet(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code
